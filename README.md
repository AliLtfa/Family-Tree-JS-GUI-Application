# Family-Tree-JS-GUI-Application


An Arabic JavaScript GUI Application for Creating Family Trees Using dTree


This project was developed in response to the noticeable lack of JavaScript applications with graphical user interfaces for building family trees. I created this lightweight application to allow users to visually create and manage their own family trees through intuitive drag-and-drop interactions.
Based on my research, this is the first JavaScript application that provides a full graphical user interface specifically for building personalized family trees.

Key Features:
1. Import and export family trees as CSV files.
2. Export the family tree as an image for easy sharing.
3. Click on any node to add a child or spouse (with selectable gender).
4. Pop-up windows allow you to edit a node’s name or gender, add a new spouse, or add a child. When adding a child, a spouse node is automatically generated with the correct gender and a default name ("غير معروف") which can be changed later.
5. The tree is fully expandable and aligns properly within the confines of a user’s browser window.

Libraries Used:
dTree.min.js
d3.v4.min.js
lodash.min.js
html2canvas (for exporting to PDF or image)
