# Family-Tree-JS-GUI-Application
An Arabic GUI JavaScript Application For Family Trees using dTree

Due to lack of JS applications that has a graphical user interface, I have decided to create this little application that allows users to create their own family trees using a click and drag and drop operations. The application has the following features:

1- Export and Import user's family tree as a CSV file.
2- Export the user's tree as an image for sharing.
3- Click on nodes to create a new child or a spouse (with gender) node.
4- A pop up window to change the node's name or gender, to add a new spouse to the child or a new child (in which case a spouse will be created automatically with the correct gender (with the name being غير معروف which can be changed) )
5- The user's own family is expandable and alligns correctly within the confines of their own browser.

The application uses the following libraries:
dTree.min.js
d3.v4.min.js
lodash.min.js
as well as html2canvas for exporting pdf or iamge file.
